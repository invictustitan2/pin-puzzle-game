# Deployment Guide

## Docker

The application is containerized using Docker. To build and run the container locally:

1.  **Build the image**:

    ```bash
    docker build -t pin-puzzle .
    ```

2.  **Run the container**:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:80 pin-puzzle
    ```

3.  Access the game at `http://localhost:8080`.

## CI/CD Service

The project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration.

-   **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
-   **Triggers**: Pushes to `main` and Pull Requests.
-   **Steps**:
    1.  Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
    2.  Build the project (`npm run build`)
    3.  Check formatting (`prettier --check`)

## Cloud Deployment (Generic)

Since the output is a static site (SPA) served by Nginx:
-   **AWS ECS/Fargate**: Push the Docker image to ECR and deploy a task definition using it.
-   **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Deploy directly from the Dockerfile in the repo.
-   **Static Hosting (Netlify/Vercel)**: You can also deploy just the `dist` folder generated by `npm run build` without Docker if preferred.
